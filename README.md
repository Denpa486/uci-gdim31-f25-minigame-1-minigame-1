# minigame-1
## Devlog
The fist attempt to this project made a completely wrong step that I created a new project in unity rather than open the file of MG1, so I finally ends up with clear every thing in github and Unity for minigame 1 and start it over. This is a new develog
*create new map for the game
*more hazard and coins
*change the speed and the height the character can jump so that players cannot jump to where they not suppose to be.
