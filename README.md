# minigame-1
## Devlog
The fist attempt to this project made a completely wrong step that I created a new project in unity rather than open the file of MG1, so I finally ends up with clear every thing in github and Unity for minigame 1 and start it over. This is a new develog
*create new map for the game
*more hazard and coins
*change the speed and the height the character can jump so that players cannot jump to where they not suppose to be.
Answer to the prompt:
The factors of games can be discribed as a stage play. Components are like the costumes, scripts, and settings of a story that define each actor’s role and point out the big direction of the game. GameObjects are the actors themselves. On their own, they’re just objects on stage. But once dressed in Components, they come alivable to move, speak, react, or sparkle. Scenes are the entire stage setup: the lighting, backdrop, cast, and choreography. It’s where the story unfolds, and where all the GameObjects perform together in harmony.
